In this game you are put into a VR environment to try to escape a strange maze and learn the mystery of the world around you. Use your hands to break apart walls, push objects and solve puzzles to gather pages that will guide you and inform you of the strange land you have found yourself in.

This game was created for the HTC Vive and The Leap Motion Plus.
